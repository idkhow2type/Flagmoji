# Flagmoji
Flag emojis aren't supported on Windows, so I created this extension to replace them with actual flag images

Download the extension for Chromium browsers [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flagmoji/bnnhpohpnamnjhajbkgpmblleljodlhd)

## Developing
`zipped.py` and `zipped` is respectively a simple build script and config file to do packaging for the web store. Run it after you're done editing the extension. (Don't upload my extension as your own though)

## Credits:
- [flagpedia.net](https://www.flagpedia.net) and Wikipedia for  flag images
